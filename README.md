  1. You can start App troughth `npm start`.
  2. At the middle in the bottom you can insert `Currency Pair` into input field and then press `Seacrh Rates` button which is below input.
  3. As well in the right top corner from `Live Wall` you can press on `Show Possible Currency Pairs` to see all possible `Currency Pairs` and click on one of them.
  After clicking selected `Currency Pair` will be set into input and you can simply press button `Seacrh Rates`.
  
  P.S. Due to `Free Plan` provided by Forex, api key only have 250 requests per day, so values in the `Live Wall` changes only every 5 seconds. 
  If you want to change it, you can go to file `src/hooks/forexService.hook` and change variable `_apiKey` to your own api key.
  And in the `src/components/app/App.js` change in the useEffect[currencyPair] inteval value from 5000ms to another.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
